Orange all the pads:
80200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800200800
80 => msg_type
20 => red
08 => green
00 => blue
Colors vary from 00 to 80

Color groups and transport:
81000020000020001020001020001020001020002000002000001020001020001020001020003c7f003c7f20000a20000a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a
81 => msg_type
then each group button has two leds so [left, right] => [[r,g,b],[r,g,b]]
then there are 8 bytes left, each ones are the light intensity (monochrome) of the 8 transport buttons
